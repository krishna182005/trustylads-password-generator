Technical Details

Tech Stack:
HTML: Structure of the user interface.
JavaScript: Handles password generation logic and interactivity.
Tailwind CSS: Provides styling via CDN (no local installation required).


Password Generation Logic:
Ensures at least one character from each selected type (if enabled).
Fills the remaining length with random characters from the selected types.
Shuffles the final password for added randomness.


Browser Compatibility: Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Hosting: Deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access.

Security Considerations

Client-Side Only: The application runs entirely in the browser, ensuring no sensitive data is sent to a server.
Randomness: Uses JavaScript's Math.random() for randomization, suitable for general-purpose password generation. For cryptographic purposes, consider using crypto.getRandomValues() in a production environment.
Input Validation: Prevents generation if no character types are selected, ensuring usable passwords.
